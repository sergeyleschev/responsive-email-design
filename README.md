🐝 Which mobile devices can you design for
--------------------------
A quick caveat: The techniques listed here aren’t universally supported by all mobile email clients. As you may know, not all email clients were made equal—even on the same device, how an HTML email displays can vary radically from inbox to inbox.

Thankfully, the iPhone and other Apple iOS devices can not only boast of near trouble-free email rendering, but also account for a large percentage of mobile email opens, too. However, with the latest release of iOS 13, Apple’s dark mode will pose new design and coding challenges to overcome so always remember to test your emails.

With this in mind, we present to you a non-exhaustive list of mobile email clients and their support for media queries. For context, media query support enables you to use many of the responsive techniques that we’ll be covering in this guide.

### Default device email clients

| Client | Media query support |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | 
| Amazon Kindle Fire | Yes |
| Amazon Kindle Fire HD | Yes |
| Android 2.1 Eclair | No |
| Android 4.x native client | Yes |
| Apple iOS | Yes |
| Gmail App for Android | Yes |
| Gmail App for iOS | Yes |
| Yahoo Android and iOS | Yes |
| Outlook Android and iOS | Yes |
| Gmail Android IMAP | No |
| Microsoft Windows Phone 7.5 | Yes |
| Microsoft Windows Phone 8 | No |
| Microsoft Surface | No |
| Windows Mail | Yes |
| Samsung Email 6x | No |

### 3rd-party email clients

There are limitations: [see supported CSS properties](https://developers.google.com/gmail/design/reference/supported_css) | Yes |
